## Variance (or heritability) explained by genetic variants

This page includes programs and R scripts to calculate the variance in liability explained (i.e. heritability explained) (Vg) by individual genetic variants. Please cite the following paper if you use the programs:


#### VarExplained program 

R program to calculate the variance explained for bi-allelic markers (.R file)

Program to calculate Vg for any number of strata (including haplotypes, multi-allelic markers and interactions) (.exe file)
